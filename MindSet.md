# Mindsets


#### We have two types of mindsets:
1.	**Fixed Mindset**
2.	**Growth mindset**

### **Fixed Mindset:**
Is having a static mind and abilities and having no ability to change better doesn’t require anything however intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits and can not be armed unless you’re gifted with them, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
#### **Advantages:**
-	People with that mindset think more before making any step in their life
-	people with that mindset work carefully because they do accept failure.
#### **Disadvantages:**
-	Do not accepting changes even if it was better
-	Do not accept failure
-	Do not try new things
-	Do not accept comments and take them personally
-	Giving Up
### **Growth Mindset**
Growth mindset is a way to improve your abilities and skills through practice and effort, it requires talent and inelegance for sure but even that could be gained through working hard on it. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
#### **Advantages:**
-	Accepting changes
-	Accepting the failure
-	Try new things
-	Accept comments
-	Working Hard 
-	Not Giving up and seeing problems as a way of improvement.
#### **Disadvantages:**
-	Rushing into things.
-	Not thinking so deep about a situation.
